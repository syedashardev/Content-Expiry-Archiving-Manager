# Content-Expiry-Archiving-Manager
The "Content Expiry &amp; Archiving Manager" plugin lets WordPress admins set expiry dates for posts, pages, or custom post types. Upon expiry, content is automatically archived, moved, or other actions are taken, like sending admin notifications. Ideal for sites with time-sensitive content, such as news or event websites.
